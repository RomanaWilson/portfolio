        <p class="project-paragraph">Utilizing a basic analysis of the file storage industry, competitive analysis of key players, as well as user research, I have identified gaps in the market and found several user frustrations with currently available products. Co lab is a cloud storage application designed to humanize collaboration and communication between teams, customers and vendors. My research demonstrated that the user is being overwhelmed by multiple tools and is losing productivity while working on projects. The main principle of Co lab is to facilitate effective collaboration between users and keep their projects organized in an easy to use structure. The application provides three viewpoints: Files, Co lab, and Talk. All of these features are unique and interconnected to create an easy workflow and help users to increase their effectivity.
        <br>  <br>
        Understanding virtual communication is a big challenge, and it has a long way to go. Co lab is a pitch of how I would approach this emerging issue. Virtual communication can get very rigid and unclear. In this project I wanted to bring simplicity and fun.

          <p class="project-paragraph">In this project I worked with three different critical productivity tools and designed an interface that allow the uninterrupted workflow between each of these tools. This allows uploading files into pre-designed organizational file strictures, real time infile collaborating with other users and facilitating discussions and planning without leaving an individual app.
            <br><br>
             Frequently users do not consider planning organization at the head of a project an important step. Bad organization will slow productivity, confuse other users and create frustration. To aide the user, I have conceptualized an option to use pre-designed industry and project specific templates for file organization. These templates can be built based on research and industry specific best practices. This would enable the user to “one-click” select proper organization and build logical pathways to his files.
             <br><br>
             It is a big challenge is to humanize collaboration between people. The productive worlds reliance on email and text based communication tools can become very frustrating as communicating verbally is not always the most clear way.  To address the need for visual and 3 dimensional communication, I devised a set of tools to help users clearly demonstrate their thoughts. In the application’s collaboration room the user can open a specific project and invite other people and visually work on adjustments. Users can pin a picture, draw, or make requests. While people are taking notes, they often lose attention and also don’t remember all information accurately. I have added the ability to record a session in case collaborators need to revisit changes that were made while in a session.
            <br><br>
            Co lab is a tool that provides more options how to bring clarity into virtual communication. The modern professional is mostly communicating via email. That causes distraction when seeing new emails coming and changing between different platforms. This causes distraction and the user loses focus. One of my intentions was to build communication in teams, groups and individuals within the product. While communicating user can navigate in files and easily share them without leaving communication. User also has access to his calendar to plan out his schedule.
            <br><br>The amount of freelancers and business of one is increasing.  Virtual collaboration is rapidly growing. Easy online collaboration will be in demand.
